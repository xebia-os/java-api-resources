### Student schedule application

- A schedule is a list of lectures, each one defined by subject, day-of-week, start & end times

- Make it possible to create a schedule as described above

- Make it possible to generate 'schedule in time' for a given period of time, defined by start and end dates. For instance, if lectures are defined like this: 

  Math Mondays 8:00-8:45, Tuesdays 10:00-10:45 

  Physics Mondays 9:00-9:45 

  Then a schedule generated for 2016.03.01 (Tue) would contain a single entry, Math

- Make it possible to answer a question 'What lecture is the student at' for any given point in time. That might be a specific lecture, non-working day, a break between lectures, or a time before or after the lectures. To make it more interesting, account for public holidays, for instance 2016.03.11 would result 'non-working day' even though there might be lectures defined for Friday.

- Make it impossible to define invalid schedule -- one with lectures overlapping, starting before 8:00 or ending after 18:00
